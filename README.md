### Hello, I'm safa soudagar 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  

## 🛠️ Projects
### *optimizing public transit flow and efficency*
*OVERVIEW:* 
-*Objective:*
To enhance the performance and reliability of public transportation systems by reducing delays, optimizing routes, and improving user satisfaction.
-*Challenges Addressed:*
Congestion during peak hours.
Inefficient routing and scheduling.
Poor resource allocation (e.g., buses, trains).
Limited accessibility for certain areas or demographics.
-*Key Strategies:*
Analyzing transit data using advanced algorithms or AI.
Implementing real-time tracking and predictive scheduling.
Incorporating dynamic routing to adapt to traffic conditions.
Promoting multi-modal transportation integration.
-*Impact:*
Reduced travel time and improved commuter experience.
Enhanced sustainability by minimizing energy usage and emissions.
Increased economic productivity through efficient transit networks.
-*Future Scope:*
Leveraging smart city technologies (IoT and sensors).
Incorporating autonomous vehicles for smoother transit operations.
Expanding equitable access to underserved areas.
*Technical Stack:*  

- *Languages:* C++, Java  
- *Algorithms:* Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- *Tools:* Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques
  *impact:*
  Optimizing public transit can reduce travel times, lower emissions, and enhance 
  accessibility. It improves cost-efficiency and boosts community connectivity. For you 
  personally, it means a faster, more reliable commute, more time for other activities, and 
  contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable city.
